# App we're building

We're working on a server monitoring software. To check a production example - Please check out Fyipe.com. 

**The app will:**
- Let users sign up and login. 
- When the user logs in - he is navigated to dashboard. 
- User can add one or more websites to monitor. 
- The app will check the website every minute and will let the user know when it's down. 
- The user will be alerted via email, call, SMS. 
- User can also attach his twitter account and the updates about the website will be posted there. 
- Dashobard will show the uptime percent from the day the `websites to monitor` were added and will also show the current status of the website - If its `Online` or `Offline`


### Why server monitoring? 
It covers most concepts to build an app - from relationships in the database, to workers, to thord party API integration and more.

**How will the app look like?**
If you have any question on how the app loosk like - Please check out Fyipe.com. Your mentor should give you a demo account for you to test things out. 

**Will I be building the exact clone?**
No, That's months or years of work. You'll be building a very simple clone - with a simple UI and few API's. 

**I have more questions - who do I ask?**
