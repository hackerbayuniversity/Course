# Guidelines

## Onboarding

We'll be sending you an invite to your registered email id to join our slack group. This group will have engineers from HackerBay, Inc. and all the international participants for a batch joining us for the program from across the globe. This group will ensure collaborative learning and healthy discussions helping you learn from multiple perspectives. We expect you to use the group for learning and healthy discussions only.

Please review this [checklist](/checklist/README.md) before you join the program. 

## One on One mentorship

As soon as you join our program, you'll be assigned a mentor who will be responsible for helping you learn and grow throughout the course. Mentors and not trainers and will NOT train you but guide you in the right direction and make sure you stay there through the course. You'll be reporting to this person and will need to keep him or her in loop every week. 

## Course Structure

We believe that learning happens best when you experiment with code from Day 1. Every week, we will post new content to the repo with `Learning Resources`, `Tasks` and clear `Deliverables` for that week. Please work on them and make sure you submit final deliverable as a `git` repo at the end of every week for your mentor to review. 

## Tasks

There are twenty tasks in this course. Ideally you should aim to complete one task per week. If you've finished a task for the week. Please feel free to work on the next one. Usually, we've seen a lot of participants do more than one task / week. The sooner you finish them all, the sooner we can have you work on real world projects. 

## Learn yourself

Discovering that you can be self taught is an amazing experience. We don't believe in the idea of someone being there to train you. It limits your potential and doesn't give you a lot of room to grow. We'll never teach you at HackerBay University. We'll however help you learn how to learn on your own so that you are set for life and don't have to wait on anyone to learn and grow. Internet is the best reosurce in the world.

## Course content

We'll be providing you contents in the form of videos and tutorials every week. The contents will be uploaded to the GitHub repository and you'll need to finish it up before the week ends. This will ensure that you don't have any learning backlogs. We also believe putting a time line to learning improves the learning efficiency and reduces lethargy.

## Practice/implementation

We'll be providing you a wide range of practice sets and tasks that you'll need to complete every week using the concepts you learn till that week. We believe only implementation can help you grow faster in learning tech. Your focus should follow the Pareto principle. If you learn for 20% of your time, you must apply it in the rest 80% of the time to learn the concept thoroughly. This will help you keep it with yourself for a long time.

## Doubts/queries resolution

Since most of you must be really new to the world of software development, we understand you'll be having a lot of doubts and queries when you start. We want you to know that it is perfectly normal and happens with everyone who starts this journey. To get through it however, you need to be more self reliant and proactive in finding solutions on your own first before asking it to your mentors. Use resources like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com), [GitHub Issue Tickets](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/), [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/) just like a real world professional would. This will not only save a lot of time of your mentors but will also help you learn a lot faster plus you'll learn how to fix issues yourself. We believe it is the best way to learn tech.

## Weekly Standups

Every week you'll be required to attend a stand-up call with your mentor and this should be considered sacred and you shouldn't miss them unless and until it's absolutely impossible to attend. Please make sure you schedule time with your mentor and have the standup at the same time every week.

## Daily updates

As is common with every world class tech companies, you are required to update your mentor everyday about the things you learnt that day no matter how less of a time you could dedicate that day for learning. Even if you learn just about using simple HTML tags, we expect you to update your mentor for the same since they are responsible to help you learn. Keeping them in the loop will allow them to help you better. You can send your daily updates to your mentor via slack.

## Code of conduct

As future developers working in world class companies, we expect you to be pleasant in your behavior with everyone.  We don't tolerate any kind of discrimination, racism or harassment at Hackerbay no matter what. Any such illicit actions would result in immediate termination and removal from the program as well as from HackerBay, Inc. forever.

## Minimum time commitment

As mentioned before, the program requires you to dedicate at least 20hrs/week throughout the duration of the course. It is the minimum amount of commitment we can expect from your side. If your are not able to fulfill this commitment you'll be warned and repetition of the same will lead to your expulsion from the program. Since the developers are taking out time to help you learn, we expect you to honor their efforts and this is the least you could do.
